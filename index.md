## Privacy Policy for Ask LLM

Last Updated: November 5, 2025

Thank you for using Ask LLM. This privacy policy explains how our extension handles your data with transparency and respect for your privacy.

### 1. Our Philosophy

Ask LLM is designed to be a private and secure tool. We do not have our own servers, and we do not collect, store, or have any access to your personal information or the content you process. Your data stays on your device and is only sent to the AI service you configure.

### 2. What Data the Extension Handles

The extension needs to handle two pieces of information to function:

API Key: To connect to a Large Language Model (LLM) provider (such as OpenRouter), you must provide your own API key. This key is an authentication credential required by the third-party service.
Highlighted Text: The core function of the extension is to process the text you select on a webpage. This text is considered website content.
### 3. How Your Data is Handled

Local Storage: Your API key and other extension settings are stored exclusively on your local computer using the chrome.storage API. This data is never transmitted to us or any other party, except as described below.
Data Transmission: When you use the extension, the highlighted text and your API key are sent directly from your browser to the API endpoint of the LLM provider you have configured in the settings. This is necessary for the service to process your request and provide a response. We, the developers of Ask LLM, do not act as an intermediary and cannot see or log this traffic.
### 4. Data Security and Third Parties

We do not sell, transfer, or use your data for any purpose other than the single purpose of the extension. The transmission of your data to the third-party LLM provider is governed by that provider's own privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review them.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to in the future. Any changes will be reflected here.
